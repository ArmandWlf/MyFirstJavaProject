# MyFirstJavaProject
This is my first Java project and code, fully functional. It reads a .txt file, splits text intro words, counts the number of words, gets to 15 most frequent words, compresses the text by replacing the top 15 words with symbols and finally writes a new .txt file named as "out" with the replaced words and a first line with the meaning of each replaced word.
